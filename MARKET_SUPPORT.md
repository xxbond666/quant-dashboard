## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### TradingView Widget Limitations

TradingView's free tier embeddable widgets have several restrictions:

1. **International Markets**: Some symbols, especially from emerging markets (India NSE, Vietnam, etc.), may show:
   - "This symbol is only available on TradingView" error
   - Missing charts or company profile data
   - Empty technical analysis indicators

2. **Affected Markets**:
   - India (NSE/BSE): Free tier support is limited
   - Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia: Partial or no support
   - Emerging market stocks: Often require paid subscription

3. **Why This Happens**:
   - TradingView's free widget tier has limited symbol availability
   - Some exchanges require commercial licensing
   - High-volume markets get priority in free tier

### Finnhub API Limitations

1. **Free Tier**:
   - Supports basic quote and company data for most exchanges
   - Real-time data delayed by 15+ minutes for non-US stocks
   - Rate limited to 60 API calls per minute
   - No access to historical minute-level bars

2. **Market-Specific**:
   - India NSE/BSE: Available but with delays
   - Chinese A-shares: Not available in free tier
   - Forex: Not available
   - Cryptocurrencies: Not available

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "This symbol is only available on TradingView"

**What this means**: TradingView's embedded widgets don't support this symbol.

**What you can still do**:
- ✅ Search for the stock using Finnhub data
- ✅ View company profile from Finnhub
- ✅ Add to watchlist (data updates available)
- ✅ See market news from Finnhub
- ❌ View interactive TradingView charts
- ❌ See technical analysis indicators from TradingView

**Solutions**:
1. **For Personal Use**: Upgrade to Finnhub/TradingView paid plans
2. **For Self-Hosted Deployments**: 
   - Upgrade API keys in your `.env` file
   - Consider alternative chart libraries (e.g., Lightweight Charts, Chart.js)

### Charts Don't Load

**Possible causes**:
- Symbol not supported on TradingView
- Network connectivity issue
- TradingView API rate limiting

**Troubleshooting**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify symbol exists on Finnhub search
3. Try a US stock (e.g., AAPL) to confirm basic functionality
4. Check your internet connection
